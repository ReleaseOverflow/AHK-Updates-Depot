# AHK-Updates-Depot


### RUN ON SENTENCE:
This root repository houses beneath it, branches containing given Autohotkey Script Engine Versions; allowing them to each double check their current local version on the machine and check it versus the versions recorded here - issuing automated reminders for any new release versions, or interacting with the GUI in some way so as to notify the user of new available updates.  


#### ADDENDUM
See  [Autoexec](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Scripts.htm#auto) routines to understand the order and manner of this type of execution.
